Guardian Video Times
====================

Quick hack on the Guardian API to work out how many videos are published by the Guardian and *when*.

Only tested on Chrome.

+   running: http://revdancatt.github.com/Guardian-Video-Times/

ToDo
====

+   Show the current week rather than last week (not much on a Monday so far for testing)
+   Allow the user to go back through weeks
+   Little frames around the video thumbnails to show which section they belong to
+   Click thru on the thumbs to the actual video
+   Pop-over on each thumb to get more informaiton.
+   "expand" the thumbs when rolled over if they are "clumped"
+   So, so, so, much more
+   Error checking
